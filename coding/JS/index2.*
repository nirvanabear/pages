            <h2>Hi!</h2><p>My name is George, and I work at a plumbing supply store in Marin County. I live in the east bay and have lived here for the past 13 years after moving here to finish my degree at UC Berkeley. I have been learning computer programming for the past five years through online CCSF classes while still working full time.</p>
            <p>I am currently working on building out pages for my very first website. I've done some backend work before on a project called <a href="https://wevote.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferr">We Vote</a>, which is a non-profit website designed to help voters make choices aligned with their values. I worked on creating a unit test in python for one of its functions. The project involved forking the existing GitHub repository, cloning it to an AWS server, and setting up a virtual environment and environment variables in order to get a development version of the site up and running. This will be my first time creating front-end content.</p>

                <li ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUg2SWWK18I">Model View Controller</a> - As I mentioned previously, most of my web studies have been on backend. This short video gives a good summary of the most common web framework design concept and shows how web applications process an HTTP request into a JSON reponse.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5mRW0jo-U4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferr">Django</a> - This was the specific web framework used in the project I worked on. This gives a step-by-step overview of the whole process of getting a web application built. Coded in Python.</li>
                <li><a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/ec2-example-managing-instances.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferr">boto3</a> - The development web app project was rather large and needed an AWS cloud server to store it. The EC2/Cloud 9 option web-based interface was pretty user friendly, but it also allowed for starting and stopping the instance with either a command line interface, or with Python script. This link details some of the uses and features of that Python library.</li>
