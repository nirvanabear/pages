            <h2>Howdy, all!</h2>
            <p>
                I've been living in the east bay for the past 15 years. I currently work at a plumbing supply store in Marin county and I've been taking coding classes at CCSF off and on for about 5 years. I've stuck mostly with programming, learning things like SQL, Python, C++, HTML/CSS and Linux shell script. The web programming has been really rewarding because of the easily visible output you can create, so I'm taking another class here to expand on that.</p>
            <p>   
                I'm hoping to give myself a wide base in programming to give myself both a breadth of understanding in various coding frameworks but also a focused concentration in writing code. Eventually I'd like to be working in the software development field. Not exactly sure where, but that is going to be a big project of mine in the next couple of months, figuring out which way I want to go. Web backend, web page design, application development, even a little machine learning. I've enjoyed bits of all of it.
