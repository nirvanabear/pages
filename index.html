            <h2>Howdy, all!</h2>
            <p>
                I've been living in the east bay for the past 15 years. I currently work at a plumbing supply store in Marin county and I've been taking coding classes at CCSF off and on for about 5 years. I've stuck mostly with programming, learning things like SQL, Python, C++, HTML/CSS and Linux shell script. The web programming has been really rewarding because of the easily visible output you can create, so I'm taking another class here to expand on that.</p>
            <p>   
                I'm hoping to give myself a wide base in programming to give myself both a breadth of understanding in various coding frameworks but also a focused concentration in writing code. Eventually I'd like to be working in the software development field. Not exactly sure where, but that is going to be a big project of mine in the next couple of months, figuring out which way I want to go. Web backend, web page design, application development, even a little machine learning. I've enjoyed bits of all of that, but it's time to pick a direction to forge ahead.

            <p>
                At least for myself, I feel like there's so much in our lives that draws our focus one way or another, all at once. It becomes bewildering trying to figure out what to respond to or prioritize first. The sentiment in the quote draws focus down to that which is most essential and encourages action to address the needs of the world around us.</p>

                <li ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUg2SWWK18I">Model View Controller</a> - Most of my web studies have been on backend. This short video gives a good summary of the most common web framework design concept and shows how web applications process an HTTP request into a JSON reponse.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5mRW0jo-U4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferr">Django</a> - This was the specific web framework used in the project I worked on. This gives a step-by-step overview of the whole process of getting a web application built. Coded in Python.</li>
                <li><a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/ec2-example-managing-instances.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferr">boto3</a> - The development web app project was rather large and needed an AWS cloud server to store it. The EC2/Cloud 9 option web-based interface was pretty user friendly, but it also allowed for starting and stopping the instance with either a command line interface, or with Python script. This link details some of the uses and features of that Python library.</li>
